## Description

Post Machine Algorithm Collaboration Software is an image editing software geared towards artists using machine learning algorithms to produce collaborative works with artificial intelligence. As an artist interested in using machine learning models to expand my creative endeavors, I've found that that some functions found in the OpenCV, NumPy, and MatPlotLib libraries can be used to quickly manipulate images in ways that are tailored towards outputs of AI collaborations. The lack of definition that results from style transfer in particular could prompt a desire to outline shapes in the composition, which can be accomplished using OpenCV's threshold segmentation and NumPy's array masking to isolate the in between pixels to be bolded. Color control can be difficult with theses models as well. MatPlotLib's colormaps give the user a dropdown menu with several options for the colorscheme of the image, as well as a second colormap for the outline that was added. Data visualization libraries are fantastic for the organization and display of data. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using them to manipulate the representative array of an image, thus, manipulating the image.
